# _Mermaid.js Learning Notes & Diagram Examples_

This repo collects everything I’m learning about Mermaid.js—from video courses and documentation to experiments and ChatGPT explanations.<br/>
Inside are short guides, solutions, and examples that helped me understand how Mermaid diagrams work in real environments.<br/>
My aim is to create a clean, practical notebook of Mermaid knowledge for myself and others.<br/>

## 📘 Guides & Learning Notes

Short, practical write-ups based on what I’m learning. Each guide focuses on solving a real problem or explaining a key concept in Mermaid.

### 1. How to Correctly Render Mermaid from Mermaid.ink in Jupyter Notebook

📄 _Learn how to display Mermaid diagrams in Jupyter Notebook using Markdown cells, Python helpers, or native renderers – and understand why Mermaid.ink links break when pasted into Python cells._<br/>
👉 [Read the guide](https://github.com/shap0011/mermaid-learning-notes/blob/main/How%20to%20render%20Mermaid%20in%20Jupyter%20Notebook.md)

### 2. Flowchart Diagrams — Syntax, Nodes, Links, Subgraphs, and Styling

📄 _A hands-on walkthrough of Mermaid flowcharts, covering core syntax, node text formatting, link types, invisible connections, subgraphs, styling rules, and interactive elements. This guide shows both raw Mermaid code and rendered diagrams, making it easier to understand how flowcharts behave in real projects._<br/>
👉 [Read the guide](https://github.com/shap0011/mermaid-learning-notes/blob/main/flowchart%20sample.md)

### 3. Sequence Diagram — Messages, Lifelines, Frames, and Real-World Flows

📄 A comprehensive guide to Mermaid sequence diagrams, covering actors and participants, message types, notes and comments, activation boxes, conditional and parallel frames (alt, opt, par, break, critical), grouping and coloring, configuration settings, and common pitfalls. The guide includes progressive examples and a real-world login flow to demonstrate how sequence diagrams model realistic system interactions.<br/>
