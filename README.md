# _Mermaid.js Learning Notes & Diagram Examples_

This repo collects everything I’m learning about Mermaid.js—from video courses and documentation to experiments and ChatGPT explanations.<br/>
Inside are short guides, solutions, and examples that helped me understand how Mermaid diagrams work in real environments.<br/>
My aim is to create a clean, practical notebook of Mermaid knowledge for myself and others.<br/>
